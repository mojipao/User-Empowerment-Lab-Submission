## Method Comparison and Analysis

### Summary of Methods

- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Found 10 topics
- **TF-IDF + K-Means Clustering**: Found 10 topics
- **Word2Vec + HDBSCAN Clustering**: Found 2 topics
- **BERTopic**: Found 2 topics
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: Found 10 topics

### Analysis of Methods

**Word Frequency Analysis**: Provides a simple overview of common terms but lacks context and can't identify complex topics.

**TF-IDF + K-Means**: Identifies topics based on distinctive terms, but can struggle with semantic relationships and requires predefined cluster count.

**Word2Vec + HDBSCAN**: Better at capturing semantic relationships between words and automatically determines number of clusters, but may identify fewer clusters if data is sparse.

**BERTopic**: Leverages contextual embeddings for more accurate topic identification and can capture nuanced semantic relationships, but is computationally intensive.

**LDA**: Traditional probabilistic topic modeling that works well on longer documents but may struggle with short texts and requires pre-defined topic count.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the most effective methods for this Reddit dataset were TF-IDF + K-Means and LDA, as they provided the most coherent and interpretable topics. The TF-IDF + K-Means approach seemed particularly well-suited for this type of social media data because it successfully identified distinct conversation clusters including AI discussions, relationship issues, technology complaints, and non-English content (French).

While Word2Vec + HDBSCAN and BERTopic only identified 2 clusters each (with one being primarily French-language content), they still provided value by revealing the strong language separation in the dataset. The simplicity of these results suggests that these methods might need parameter tuning or more data to perform optimally on this particular dataset.

LDA produced particularly meaningful topics that align well with common Reddit discussions, identifying clear themes around AI technology, work-life struggles, and relationship issues. The ability of LDA to produce interpretable word groups that represent coherent discussion topics makes it especially valuable for analyzing conversational social media data.

Word Frequency Analysis, while the simplest method, still provided useful insights into the most common terms used across the dataset, highlighting the prevalence of subjective and emotional language ("like", "feel", "want") in Reddit discussions.

Overall, a multi-method approach provided the most comprehensive understanding of the Reddit data, with each technique revealing different aspects of the underlying topic structure.
